CREATED:20150313T110900Z
DESCRIPTION: The Lyrids is an average shower\, usually producing about 20 m
 eteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust particles left behind b
 y comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher\, which was discovered in 1861. The shower runs 
 annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of 
 the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce brigh
 t dust trails that last for several seconds.  The first quarter moon will s
 et shortly after midnight\, leaving fairly dark skies for the what could be
  a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Met
 eors will radiate from the constellation Lyra\, but can appear anywhere in 
 the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

 3. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the nig
 ht of the 3rd and  morning of the 4th. This year the nearly full moon will 
 block out most of the fainter meteors. But if you are patient you may still
  be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark locatio
 n after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes\, but 
 can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

DESCRIPTION: The Perseids is one of the best meteor showers to observe\, pr
 oducing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by comet Swif
 t-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for produc
 ing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17
  to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 12 and the morning
  of August 13. The waning gibbous moon will block out many of the fainter m
 eteors this year\, but the Perseids are so bright and numerous that it shou
 ld still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after mi
 dnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Perseus\, but can appea

 has also been known as the Green Corn Moon and the Grain Moon. Since this i
 s the third of four full moons in this season\, it is known as a blue moon.
  This rare calendar event only happens once every few years\, giving rise t
 o the term\, “once in a blue moon.” There are normally only three full moon
 s in each season of the year. But since full moons occur every 29.53 days\,
  occasionally a season will contain 4 full moons. The extra full moon of th
 e season is known as a blue moon. Blue moons occur on average once every 2.
 7 years. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

 block out most of the fainter meteors. But if you are patient you may still

DESCRIPTION: The Lyrids is an average shower\, usually producing about 20 m
 eteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust particles left behind b
 y comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher\, which was discovered in 1861. The shower runs 
 annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of 
 the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce brigh
 t dust trails that last for several seconds.  The waning gibbous moon will 
 block many of the fainter meteors this year. But if you are patient\, you m
 ay still be able to catch a few of the brighter ones. Best viewing will be 
 from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constell
 ation Lyra\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.sea

CREATED:20150313T110904Z
DESCRIPTION: The Lyrids is an average shower\, usually producing about 20 m
 eteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust particles left behind b
 y comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher\, which was discovered in 1861. The shower runs 
 annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of 
 the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce brigh
 t dust trails that last for several seconds.  The waning gibbous moon will 
 block out many of the fainter meteors this year\, but if you are patient yo
 u should still be able to catch a few of the brightest ones. Best viewing w
 ill be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the c
 onstellation Lyra\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://

DESCRIPTION: The Leonids is an average shower\, producing up to 15 meteors 
 per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak 
 about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That l
 ast of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains left 
 behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1865. The shower ru
 ns annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 17th
  and morning of the 18th. Unfortunately the nearly full moon will obscure a
 ll but the brightest meteors this year. But if you are patient\, you should
  still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark l
 ocation after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Leo\, b
 ut can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

  6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. The waning gibbous m
 oon will block out most of the fainter meteors this year. But if you are ex
 tremely patient\, you may still be able to catch a few good ones. Best view

DESCRIPTION: The Quadrantids is an above average shower\, with up to 40 met
 eors per hour at its peak. It is thought to be produced by dust grains left
  behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1\, which was discovered in 200
 3. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the nig
 ht of the 3rd and  morning of the 4th. The thin\, crescent moon will set ea
 rly in the evening leaving dark skies for what should be an excellent show.
  Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will rad
 iate from the constellation Bootes\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (c

DESCRIPTION: The Perseids is one of the best meteor showers to observe\, pr
 oducing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by comet Swif
 t-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for produc
 ing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17
  to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 12 and the morning
  of August 13. The waxing gibbous moon will block some of the fainter meteo
 rs this year. But the Perseids are so bright and numerous that this should 
 still be a good show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midni
 ght. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Perseus\, but can appear a
 nywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

DESCRIPTION: The planet Mercury reaches greatest eastern elongation of 18.6
  degrees from the Sun. This is the best time to view Mercury since it will 
 be at its highest point above the horizon in the evening sky. Look for the 
 planet low in the western sky just after sunset. (copyright: http://www.sea

CREATED:20150313T110904Z
DESCRIPTION: The Lyrids is an average shower\, usually producing about 20 m
 eteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust particles left behind b
 y comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher\, which was discovered in 1861. The shower runs 
 annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of 
 the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce brigh
 t dust trails that last for several seconds.  The waning gibbous moon will 
 block out many of the fainter meteors this year\, but if you are patient yo
 u should still be able to catch a few of the brightest ones. Best viewing w
 ill be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the c
 onstellation Lyra\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://

 about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That l
 ast of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains left 
 behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1865. The shower ru
 ns annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 17th
  and morning of the 18th. The nearly full moon will block most of the faint
 er meteors this year. But if you are patient\, you may still be able to cat
 ch a few of the brighter ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location af

 annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of 
 the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce brigh
 t dust trails that last for several seconds.  This is an excellent year for
  the Lyrids. The new moon means dark skies  all night for what should an ex
 cellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Met

 so been known as the Sprouting Grass Moon\, the Growing Moon\, and the Egg

DESCRIPTION: The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower\, capable of produ
 cing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen in
  the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere\, the rate can reach a
 bout 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind by c
 omet Halley\, which has known and observed since ancient times. The shower 
 runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night of M
 ay 6 and the morning of the May 7. The nearly new moon means dark skies for
  what should be an excellent show this year. Best viewing will be from a da
 rk location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aqu
 arius\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.o

 arly morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from October
  6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. Unfortunately the gl

 bined with the low hourly rate it would probably be best to skip this one u

 constellation Draco\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http:

DESCRIPTION: The Perseids is one of the best meteor showers to observe\, pr
 oducing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by comet Swif
 t-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for produc
 ing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17
  to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 11 and the morning
  of August 12. The first quarter moon will block out some of the fainter me
 teors in the early evening. But the Moon will set shortly after midnight le
 aving dark skies for what could be an excellent early morning show. Best vi
 ewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate fro
 m the constellation Perseus\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyrigh

CREATED:20150313T110913Z
DESCRIPTION: The Leonids is an average shower\, producing up to 15 meteors 
 per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak 
 about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That l
 ast of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains left 
 behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1865. The shower ru
 ns annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 17th
  and morning of the 18th. The second quarter moon will block some of the fa
 inter meteors this year. But if you are patient\, you should still be able 
 to catch quite a few of the brighter ones. Best viewing will be from a dark
  location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Leo\,
  but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

DESCRIPTION: The Ursids is a minor meteor shower producing about 5-10 meteo
 rs per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tuttle\, wh
 ich was first discovered in 1790. The shower runs annually from December 17
 -25. It peaks this year on the the night of the 21st and morning of the 22n
 d. The thin\, crescent moon should not be too much of a problem this year. 
 The skies will be dark enough for what could be a really good show. Best vi
 ewing will be just after midnight from a dark location far away from city l
 ights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Ursa Minor\, but can app
 ear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

 annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of 
 the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce brigh
 t dust trails that last for several seconds.  The nearly full moon will be 
 a problem this year. Its glare will block out all but the brightest meteors
 . But if you are patient you may still be able to catch a few good ones. Be
 st viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiat

 er hour at its peak. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Hal
 ley\, which has been known and observed since ancient times. The shower run
 s annually from October 2 to November 7. It peaks this year on the night of
  October 21 and the morning of October 22. This is an excellent year for th
 e Orionids. The waxing crescent moon moon will set early in the evening lea
 ving dark skies for what should be an excellent show. Best viewing will be 
 from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constell

CREATED:20150313T110900Z
DESCRIPTION: The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower\, capable of produ
 cing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen in
  the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere\, the rate can reach a
 bout 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind by c
 omet Halley\, which has known and observed since ancient times. The shower 
 runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night of M
 ay 5 and the morning of the May 6. The nearly full moon will be a big probl
 em this year blocking out all but the brightest meteors. If you are patient
 \, you should still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be 
 from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constell
 ation Aquarius\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www

 iacobini-Zinner\, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an u
 nusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead of e
 arly morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from October
  6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 8th. The second quarter m
 oon will block out all but the brightest meteors this year. If you are pati
 ent\, you may be able to spot a few good ones. Best viewing will be in the 
 early evening from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will 
 radiate from the constellation Draco\, but can appear anywhere in the sky.

DESCRIPTION: The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing on
 ly about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two se
 parate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Asteroi
 d 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Comet 2
 P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It peaks
  this year on the the night of November 4. The first quarter moon will set 
 just after midnight leaving dark skies for viewing. Best viewing will be ju
 st after midnight from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors w
 ill radiate from the constellation Taurus\, but can appear anywhere in the 
 sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

 ing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17
  to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 12 and the morning
  of August 13. The waxing gibbous moon will set shortly after midnight\, le
 aving fairly dark skies for should be an excellent early morning show. Best
  viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate 
 from the constellation Perseus\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyr

DESCRIPTION: The Geminids is the  king of the meteor showers. It is conside
 red by many to be the best shower in the heavens\, producing up to 120 mult
 icolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind
  by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon\, which was discovered in 1982. The 
 shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the night of
  the 13th and morning of the 14th. This is an excellent year for viewing th
 e Geminids. The waxing crescent moon will set early in the evening leaving 
 dark skies for what should be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from 
 a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation
  Gemini\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky

DESCRIPTION: The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower\, capable of produ
 cing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen in
  the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere\, the rate can reach a
 bout 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind by c
 omet Halley\, which has known and observed since ancient times. The shower 
 runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night of M
 ay 6 and the morning of the May 7. The waning crescent moon will block some
  of the fainter meteors this year. But if you are patient\, you should stil
 l should be able to catch a quite a few of the brighter ones. Best viewing 
 will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the 
 constellation Aquarius\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: ht

DESCRIPTION: The Leonids is an average shower\, producing an average of up

 t grains left behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1865.
  The shower runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the nig
 ht of the 17th and morning of the 18th. The second quarter moon will block 
 many of the fainter meteors this year. But the Leonids can be unpredictable
  so there is still potential for a good show. Best viewing will be from a d
 ark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Le
 o\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

 iameter. The giant space rock will pass as close as 19\,400 miles (31\,300 
 kilometers) to the Earth's surface. This will bring it within the orbits of
  geosynchronous communication satellites. It may reach a magnitude of 3.4\,
  making it visible to the naked eye from a dark night sky location. Since t
 here will be no moon\, this could be a spectacular event. Though it will be
  an extremely close encounter\, there is only a on in a million chance of t
 he asteroid actually hitting the Earth. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

 you should still be able to catch quite a few of the brighter ones if you a
 re patient. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteo
 rs will radiate from the constellation Perseus\, but can appear anywhere in

DESCRIPTION: The Perseids is one of the best meteor showers to observe\, pr
 oducing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by comet Swif
 t-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1862. The Perseids are famous for produc
 ing a large number of bright meteors. The shower runs annually from July 17
  to August 24. It peaks this year on the night of August 12 and the morning
  of August 13. This is an excellent year for the Perseids. There will be no
  moonlight to interfere with the show so be prepared for what could be an i
 mpressive display. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight
 . Meteors will radiate from the constellation Perseus\, but can appear anyw
 here in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

CREATED:20150313T110907Z
DESCRIPTION: The Lyrids is an average shower\, usually producing about 20 m
 eteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by dust particles left behind b
 y comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher\, which was discovered in 1861. The shower runs 
 annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of 
 the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce brigh
 t dust trails that last for several seconds.  The thin crescent moon will s
 et early in the evening leaving dark skies for what should be an excellent 
 show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors wil
 l radiate from the constellation Lyra\, but can appear anywhere in the sky.

CREATED:20150313T110906Z
DESCRIPTION: The Leonids is an average shower\, producing up to 15 meteors 
 per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak 
 about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That l
 ast of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains left 
 behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1865. The shower ru
 ns annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 17th
  and morning of the 18th. Unfortunately the nearly full moon will dominate 
 the sky this year\, blocking all but the brightest meteors. But if you are 
 patient\, you should still be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing w
 ill be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the c
 onstellation Leo\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://w

 meteors. If you are extremely patient\, you might still be able to catch a 
 few good ones. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dark locatio

 parate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Asteroi
 d 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Comet 2
 P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It peaks
  this year on the the night of November 4. The first quarter moon will bloc
 k some of the fainter meteors in the evening. But it will set shortly after
  midnight\, leaving dark skies for what should be a good early morning show
 . Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dark location far away fr
 om city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Taurus\, but ca

 annually from April 16-25. It peaks this year on the night of the night of 
 the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce brigh
 t dust trails that last for several seconds.  The waning gibbous moon will 
 block many of the fainter meteors this year. But if you are patient\, you m
 ay still be able to catch a few of the brighter ones. Best viewing will be 
 from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constell
 ation Lyra\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.sea

DESCRIPTION: The Geminids is the  king of the meteor showers. It is conside
 red by many to be the best shower in the heavens\, producing up to 120 mult
 icolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind
  by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon\, which was discovered in 1982. The 
 shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the night of
  the 13th and morning of the 14th. The glare from the waning gibbous moon w
 ill obscure many of the fainter meteors this year. But the Geminids are so 
 bright and numerous that this could still be a good show. Best viewing will
  be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the cons
 tellation Gemini\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://w

 has also been known as the Green Corn Moon and the Grain Moon. Since this i
 s the third of four full moons in this season\, it is known as a blue moon.
  This rare calendar event only happens once every few years\, giving rise t
 o the term\, “once in a blue moon.” There are normally only three full moon
 s in each season of the year. But since full moons occur every 29.53 days\,
  occasionally a season will contain 4 full moons. The extra full moon of th
 e season is known as a blue moon. Blue moons occur on average once every 2.
 7 years. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

 t 23:09 UTC. This full moon was known by early Native American tribes as th
 e Full Snow Moon because the heaviest snows usually fell during this time o
 f the year. Since hunting is difficult\, this moon has also been known by s
 ome tribes as the Full Hunger Moon\, since the harsh weather made hunting d
 ifficult. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

DESCRIPTION: The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower\, capable of produ
 cing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen in
  the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere\, the rate can reach a
 bout 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind by c
 omet Halley\, which has known and observed since ancient times. The shower 
 runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night of M
 ay 6 and the morning of the May 7. The thin crescent moon will set early in
  the evening leaving dark skies for what should be a good show. Best viewin
 g will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from th
 e constellation Aquarius\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright:

 block out most of the fainter meteors this year. But if you are patient\, y

CREATED:20150313T110913Z
DESCRIPTION: The Taurids is a long-running minor meteor shower producing on
 ly about 5-10 meteors per hour. It is unusual in that it consists of two se
 parate streams. The first is produced by dust grains left behind by Asteroi
 d 2004 TG10. The second stream is produced by debris left behind by Comet 2
 P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It peaks
  this year on the the night of November 4. The waxing gibbous moon will blo
 ck most of the fainter meteors in the evening. But it will set a few hours 
 after midnight leaving dark skies for what could be a good early morning sh
 ow. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dark location far away 
 from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Taurus\, but 
 can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

 his year\, blocking out all but the brightest meteors. If you are patient\,
  you should still should be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing wil

DESCRIPTION: The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10
  meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P G
 iacobini-Zinner\, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an u
 nusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead of e
 arly morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from October
  6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. Unfortunately the gl
 are from the nearly full moon will block most of the meteors this year. Com
 bined with the low hourly rate it would probably be best to skip this one u
 nless you are really patient. Best viewing will be in the early evening fro
 m a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the 
 constellation Draco\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http:

 n Mars and Jupiter. Because of its size and shape\, it has officially been 
 classified as a dwarf planet\, which puts it in the same category as Pluto.
  Ceres is 590 miles (950 kilometers) in diameter and is large enough to hav
 e a round shape. Dawn will spend several months studying Ceres and will sen
 d back the first close-up images of a dwarf planet in our Solar System. (co

 ak about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. Tha
 t last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains le
 ft behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1865. The shower
  runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the 1
 7th and morning of the 18th. The first quarter moon will set shortly after 
 midnight leaving fairly dark skies for what could be a good show. Best view
 ing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from 
 the constellation Leo\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: htt

DESCRIPTION: The Geminids is the  king of the meteor showers. It is conside
 red by many to be the best shower in the heavens\, producing up to 120 mult
 icolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind
  by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon\, which was discovered in 1982. The 
 shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the night of
  the 13th and morning of the 14th. The waning crescent moon will be no matc
 h for the Geminids this year. The skies should still be dark enough for an 
 excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. M
 eteors will radiate from the constellation Gemini\, but can appear anywhere
  in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)

DESCRIPTION: The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower\, capable of produ
 cing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen in
  the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere\, the rate can reach a
 bout 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind by c
 omet Halley\, which has known and observed since ancient times. The shower 
 runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night of M
 ay 6 and the morning of the May 7. The waning crescent moon will block some
  of the fainter meteors this year. But if you are patient\, you should stil
 l should be able to catch a quite a few of the brighter ones. Best viewing 
 will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the 
 constellation Aquarius\, but can appear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: ht

DESCRIPTION: The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10
  meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P G
 iacobini-Zinner\, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an u
 nusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead of e
 arly morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from October
  6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. This year\, the near
 ly new moon will leave dark skies for what should be an excellent show. Bes
 t viewing will be in the early evening from a dark location far away from c
 ity lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Draco\, but can app
 ear anywhere in the sky. (copyright: http://www.seasky.org)
